One Chunk Survival is a type of map where you have to survive in a single chunk. this is my version of the map. I hope you like it :)

**for the moment the map is in alpha, write to me if you have any suggestions I found a bug**

# Story: 

_Alex and Steve were suddenly trapped in a 16x16 area (called chunck). who did it? but above all, will you be able to survive?_

# Feature:

- a survival map inspired by Skyblock and Ant Farm survival
- multiplayer is not supported at the moment but will be in the future :)
- 100% vanilla
- all dimensions is available (End is broken for now but will be fixed)
